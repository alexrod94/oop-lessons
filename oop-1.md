## Learning Goals

After this lesson you will be able to:

- Explain what Object Oriented Programming is
- Comprehend the importance of thinking about objects
- Create objects with the literal pattern
- Access properties of an object
- Use the `this` keyword

## Introduction

:::success
Official definition of [**object-oriented programming (OOP)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is that it is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as _attributes_), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as _methods_).
:::

Okay, so the main take away from this is - **objects** are the main key/tool/means of OOP. We will try to explain this through example.

### Ways of constructing the objects

Some of these topics we already covered but now we will take them one step ahead.

- Object Literals

In this lesson, we will create a very simple Monopoly game with 16 squares and 3 players. At every turn, a player launches one dice, moves forward and updates their cash based on the square's value.

You can see an example below illustrating the game we will create:

If we use _object literal_ approach, which is the simplest approach we've seen so far, we could simulate the game the following way:

```javascript
// Example of a VERY simple Monopoly game simulation

// Each square represents the cash earned when a player is on it. For example:
// - If a user is at position 0, the cash will increase by 100€
// - If a user is at position 4, the cash will decrease by 40€
const squares = [100, -10, 0, 0, -40, -10, -10, 5, 0, -10, -50, -10, 0, 0, -50, -10];

// --- Initialization ---
let dice;

let player1 = {
  name: 'Joaquim',
  color: 'red',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000
};

let player2 = {
  name: 'Maxence',
  color: 'blue',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000
};

let player3 = {
  name: 'Mostafa',
  color: 'black',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000
};

// --- Turn of Player 1 ---
// The dice is a random integer between 1 and 6
dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
// The position is always between 0 and 15 (the numbers of squares - 1)
player1.position = (player1.position + dice) % squares.length;
// The cash is updated based on the values of squares and player1.position
player1.cash += squares[player1.position];
// If the player doesn't have anymore cash, player is out of game
if (player1.cash < 0) {
  console.log(`Game over for ${player1.name}.`);
}

// --- Turn of Player 2 ---
dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
player2.position = (player2.position + dice) % squares.length;
player2.cash += squares[player2.position];
if (player2.cash < 0) {
  console.log(`Game over for ${player2.name}.`);
}

// --- Turn of Player 3 ---
dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
player3.position = (player3.position + dice) % squares.length;
player3.cash += squares[player3.position];
if (player3.cash < 0) {
  console.log(`Game over for ${player3.name}.`);
}

// --- Display info  ---
console.log(player1);
console.log(player2);
console.log(player3);
```

Using this simple approach has some **pros**:

- it's super convenient, straight-forward
- very flexible in a declaration
- very little code when declaring them
- you can create them at any point in your code and use them without a lot of previous set up

However, this approach has some **cons** as well:

- **We don't have a fast way to create the object**. Instead, we always have to specify all the properties, which means a lot of copy pasting and making minor changes from object to object. (In our previous example, we are initializing the `position` to `0` and the `cash` to `1000`.)

- **We don't have any methods for our objects**. It would be nice to have a method `player.move()` instead of writing the same code again and again.

## Object methods and `this` keyword

Let's change our code to add 2 methods: `move()` and `displayInfo()`.

```javascript
// Example of a VERY simple Monopoly game simulation

let squares = [100, -10, 0, 0, -40, -10, -10, 5, 0, -10, -50, -10, 0, 0, -50, -10];

// --- Initialization with methods ---

let player1 = {
  name: 'Joaquim',
  color: 'red',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000,
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash < 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  },
  displayInfo {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}€`);
  },
};

let player2 = {
  name: 'Maxence',
  color: 'blue',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000,
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash < 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  },
  displayInfo () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}€`);
  },
};

let player3 = {
  name: 'Mostafa',
  color: 'black',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000,
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash < 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  },
  displayInfo () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}€`);
  },
};

// --- Turn 1  ---
player1.move();
player2.move();
player3.move();

// --- Turn 2  ---
player1.move();
player2.move();
player3.move();

// --- Display info  ---
player1.displayInfo();
player2.displayInfo();
player3.displayInfo();
```

Let's analyze the new code and compare it to the previous one.

As we can see, the **code is more readable**, especially the part for "Turn 1" and "Turn 2".

Our objects `player1`, `player2` and `player3` now have 2 extra properties: `move` and `displayInfo`. Both of them are functions, called **methods**, and they have a new keyword: **`this`**.
In this context, **`this`** refers to the current object. For `player1`, inside the `displayInfo`, `this.name` === `player1.name` === `Joaquim`.

:::success
When invoking a method on an object, **`this` becomes the object itself**.
:::

The last problem with have is that we don’t have a fast way to create the objects `player1`, `player2` and `player3`. We will solve this problem in the next lecture!

:memo: **Time to practice**

#### Exercise with `this`

```javascript
// TODO: write the methods getAge, addJoke and getRandomJoke

const chuck = {
  firstName: 'Chuck',
  lastName: 'Norris',
  birthDate: new Date('1940-03-10'),
  jokes: ['Chuck Norris counted to infinity... Twice.', 'Chuck Norris is the only man to ever defeat a brick wall in a game of tennis'],
  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} and I have ${this.jokes.length} jokes.`);
  },
  getAge() {
    // TODO
    // Hint: to get the current time, you can do: new Date()
    // Hint: to get the birthDate, you can do: this.birthDate
    // Hint: you can subtract 2 dates and you get the number of milliseconds
  },
  addJoke(joke) {
    // TODO (don't use return statement)
  },
  getRandomJoke() {
    // TODO
  }
};

chuck.displayInfo();

console.log('getAge', chuck.getAge()); // Should return 80 if you are in 2020

chuck.addJoke('Chuck Norris can divide by zero.');
console.log('getRandomJoke', chuck.getRandomJoke());
chuck.addJoke('Chuck Norris kills flies with his gun.');
console.log('getRandomJoke', chuck.getRandomJoke());
chuck.addJoke('Chuck Norris was once in a knife fight, and the knife lost.');
console.log('getRandomJoke', chuck.getRandomJoke());

chuck.displayInfo();
```

## Summary

We've seen how to create methods (a function linked to an object) and we've seen the keyword **`this`** that refers to the current object.
